# Cloud Event Proxy Authentication Test Script
# ============================================
# 
# This script demonstrates and validates the authentication security of the cloud-event-proxy
# server running in OpenShift linuxptp-daemon pods. It tests both success and failure cases
# for DELETE subscription operations which require dual authentication (mTLS + OAuth).
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Must be run from within a consumer pod that has proper certificates mounted
# - Consumer pod must be in the same cluster as the ptp-event-publisher service
# - ServiceAccount token must be available at standard location
#
# Usage:
#   oc -n cloud-events exec -it deployment/cloud-consumer-deployment -- bash < auth-test-script.sh
#
# Expected Results:
# - Tests 1-3 should FAIL with 401 Unauthorized (demonstrating security)
# - Test 4 should SUCCEED with 204 No Content (demonstrating proper authentication)
